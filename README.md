This project focuses on developing a new discount strategy for the company's four main products, aiming to maximize revenue. The strategy leverages logistic regression analysis and optimization modeling techniques to identify the optimal discounts for each opportunity.

**Approach**

**1. Logistic Regression Analysis:** 

Logistic regression was utilized to analyze the impact of discount, price amount, and New Logo status on winning probabilities for opportunities. The analysis revealed the influential factors affecting the chances of winning an opportunity.

**2. Optimization Modeling:** 

The holdout sample was used to perform optimization modeling, resulting in the determination of optimized discounts for each opportunity. The average optimized discount for the holdout sample was calculated to be 13,557, providing insight into the potential revenue improvements.

**Results**

**1. Average Actual Discount:** 

Through optimization modeling, an average actual discount of 12,685 was achieved for the holdout sample, indicating the effectiveness of the strategy in reducing discounts.

**2. Expected Revenue Improvement:** 

The performance of the logistic regression model was evaluated by comparing the expected revenue improvement over un-optimized discounts for leads in the holdout sample. The analysis demonstrated significant revenue improvements across all four products, with the Direct - Cloud product exhibiting the highest increase in revenue.

**3. Optimized Revenue Comparison:** 

By comparing the optimized revenue with the actual revenue, the effectiveness of the discount strategy was highlighted, showcasing improved revenue performance for all four products.

The findings and insights obtained from this project provide valuable guidance for enhancing revenue generation through an optimized discount strategy.
